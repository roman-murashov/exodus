  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      This method deletes a previously allocated <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream.AudioStream.AudioBuffer">AudioBuffer</PageRef> object
      which was returned by the <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream.AudioStream.CreateAudioBuffer">CreateAudioBuffer</PageRef> method.
      This method only needs to be used if the caller wants to delete a previously allocated buffer without playing it. If a buffer is sent for playback
      through a call to the <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream.AudioStream.PlayBuffer">PlayBuffer</PageRef> method, the AudioStream class
      will delete it automatically after playback is complete.
