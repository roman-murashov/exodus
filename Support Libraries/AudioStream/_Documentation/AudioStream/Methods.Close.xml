    <Paragraph>
      The Close method does the reverse of the <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream.AudioStream.Open">Open</PageRef> method, that is, if
      an audio output device has previously been opened, it terminates the worker thread which is managing audio playback, and closes the handle to
      the audio output device. If a device is open when the AudioStream object is destroyed, it is closed automatically.
