  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      The Open method opens a handle to the audio output device to use for playback, and spawns a worker thread to manage playback of the supplied
      audio data to that device. If an output device is already open for this AudioStream, it is closed before the open attempt is processed. After
      opening an audio output device, it can be closed again by calling the <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream.AudioStream.Close">Close</PageRef>
      method. If a device is open when the AudioStream object is destroyed, it is closed automatically.

    <SubSection Title="Argument list">
      <ArgumentList>
        <ArgumentListEntry Type="unsigned int" Name="achannelCount">
          The number of channels in the audio data being sent for playback. Note that this does not need to match the number of channels being used by
          the actual playback device. This number should be set to the actual number of channels that are present in the audio stream being played.
        </ArgumentListEntry>
        <ArgumentListEntry Type="unsigned int" Name="abitsPerSample">
          The number of bits in a single sample entry for a single channel in the audio stream.
        </ArgumentListEntry>
        <ArgumentListEntry Type="unsigned int" Name="asamplesPerSec">
          The output sample rate to use on the audio output device. This must be set to a sample rate which is supported by the audio hardware on the
          computer, such as 44100 or 48000. Note that this is generally going to be different to the sample rate of the actual data being generated by
          an emulation core. Where the playback sample rate differs from the sample rate of the generated data, the
          <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream.AudioStream.ConvertSampleRate">ConvertSampleRate</PageRef> method should be used to resample
          the audio data prior to sending it for playback. Right now no assistance is provided to determine what sample rates are supported by the
          local computer. See the <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream">AudioStream library overview</PageRef> for more information on
          this.
        </ArgumentListEntry>
        <ArgumentListEntry Type="unsigned int" Name="amaxPendingSamples">
          The maximum number of samples that should be buffered in the Windows audio buffers at any one time. The lower this value, the less latency
          there is between sending audio data to the AudioStream and the actual playback of that audio data on the hardware, however this also
          reduces the tolerance of the audio playback to variations in speed at which the audio data is supplied. If the default value of 0 is used,
          the AudioStream will use a default calculation of samplesPerSec/4.
        </ArgumentListEntry>
        <ArgumentListEntry Type="unsigned int" Name="aminPlayingSamples">
          The minimum number of samples that are allowed to be buffered in the Windows audio buffers at any one time, before filler sample buffers are
          inserted to avoid clicks and pops if the buffer was to underflow. This should be set to a value as low as possible, before clicks or pops
          begin appearing in the audio playback. If the default value of 0 is used, the AudioStream will use a default calculation of
          samplesPerSec/20.
