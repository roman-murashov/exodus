    <Paragraph>
      The AudioStream class is designed to allow simple low-latency gapless audio playback on Windows, even when the sample data being output isn't
      generated at a constant rate. Measures are taken to prevent audio artifacts that can occur from buffer underruns, and synchronization problems
      from sample data arriving too quickly or at a varying rate. See the overall description of the
      <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.AudioStream">AudioStream library</PageRef> for further info.
