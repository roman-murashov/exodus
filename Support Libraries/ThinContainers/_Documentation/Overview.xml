  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      This library provides a limited set of containers that have been specifically engineered to provide the most performance and space efficient
      containers possible, at the cost of usability. These containers are essentially convenient thin structures over raw memory buffers, and are not
      intended for general use. These containers were designed and written specifically for the BusInterface class after extensive profiling and
      thought, to provide high speed access to the very large and open-ended bus mapping information, which is one of the most critical components in
      the performance of the emulator.
