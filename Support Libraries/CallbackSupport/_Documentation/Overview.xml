  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      The CallbackSupport library provides classes to make callbacks easier to manage in C++. Ccurrently, the library provides a set of types to
      assist in implementing an observer pattern, where interested parties can register themselves as observers of an entity, and be notified when
      an event occurs that observers should be notified about.

    <Paragraph>
      This library is relatively new, although it is reasonably well implemented. The current implementation is not feature complete however. One
      significant improvement would be to template the <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.CallbackSupport.IObserverCollection">IObserverCollection</PageRef>
      and <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.CallbackSupport.IObserverSubscription">IObserverSubscription</PageRef> interfaces using variadic
      templates to allow an arbitrary number and type of arguments to be passed to observers when they are notified.
