  <Section Title="Status of the library">
    <Paragraph>
      This library is imatture and not very well thought out. There are some things in here that should probably be moved out into the
      <PageRef PageName="SupportLibraries.WindowsSupport">WindowsSupport</PageRef> library. It might even be better to merge this entire library into
      that library.
