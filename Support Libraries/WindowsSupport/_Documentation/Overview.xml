  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      The WindowsSupport library is a Windows-specific library that has been written to provide more convenient access to the Win32 API. The intention
      of this library is not to wrap the Win32 API, but rather, to include its standard headers with the necessary preprocessor macros defined first,
      and to suppliment the Win32 library for functions that are particularly hard to use by default, or are used often enough for a simpler wrapper
      for them to be convenient. Many of the wrappers added here are designed to allow strings to be worked with as std::wstring objects rather than
      raw character buffers, which simplifies the use of many functions. All places in code should include this library rather than directly including
      the windows.h header file.

  <Section Title="Status of the library">
    <Paragraph>
      This support library has not been designed as such, it is simply viewed as a set of convenient extensions to the Win32 API, which have been
      added to as needed. It is not currently formally documented, and a review of all existing functions would be appropriate before attempting to do
      this. It is worth noting that it may also be appropriate to shift all the functions in this library into a namespace, to explicitly separate
      them from the global scope. Users of the library could apply a using statement if they wanted to be able to use the Win32 function wrappers
      without qualifying them with the namespace.
