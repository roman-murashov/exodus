    <Paragraph>
      This entire library needs to be deprecated, and a new general "CompressionSupport" library created to replace it, which can provide an abstract
      way of working with the concept of a file library, with support for multiple forms of compression, not just ZIP compression. The support for
      file library compression should also just provide support for these high level container formats like ZIP, while actual lower level data
      compression algorithms, like deflate, or any other supported compression method, should be exposed through generic functions that operate on
      data streams, like we currently have for deflate compression in this ZIP support library.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      Since this library is intended to be replaced with a better support library, it is not currently documented here.
