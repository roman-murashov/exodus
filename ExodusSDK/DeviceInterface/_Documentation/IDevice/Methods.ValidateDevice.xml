  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      The ValidateDevice method gives devices a chance to notify the system if there's some aspect of the configuration of the device that is invalid.
      Every loaded device is validated after system modules are loaded or unloaded, so devices must be able to allow this method to run multiple
      times, and at potentially any time after device creation. Returning false from this method indicates that the device cannot execute with the
      current configuration.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The main purpose of this method is to validate the device connections to other devices. The <PageRef PageName="ExodusSDK.DeviceInterface.IDevice.AddReference">AddReference</PageRef>
      method is called during device construction to link it to other devices. If a required link for a device has not been established, the
      ValidateDevice method should return false.

    <SubSection Title="Return value">
      <ReturnValue Type="bool">
        True if the device was validated successfully, false otherwise. If a device returns false from this method, the system will consider the
        device to be in an invalid state, and the system will not be allowed to execute.
