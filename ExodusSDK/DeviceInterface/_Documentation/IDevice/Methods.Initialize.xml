    <Paragraph>
      The Initialize method should return the device to a clean default state, the same as if the device had just been created. The Exodus Platform
      calls the Initialize method on each device to perform a "hard reset" of the system back to an initial power-on state. Persistent state should
      not be cleared when Initialize is called, but any volatile state should be reset to the correct initial state for power-on.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      The Initialize method is called on all devices after they are created, and then could be called at any time afterwards when a hard reset is
      performed.
