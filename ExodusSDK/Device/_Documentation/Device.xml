    <Paragraph>
      The Device class provides a default implementation of the <PageRef PageName="ExodusSDK.DeviceInterface.IDevice">IDevice</PageRef>
      interface. It is provided simply as a convenience to avoid the need for a device to provide an implementation for each pure virtual function in
      the IDevice interface, even if many of those methods are not required. Devices are free to derive from this base class, or to implement the
      IDevice interface directly.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
      As this class doesn't add any functionality that isn't present in the <PageRef PageName="ExodusSDK.DeviceInterface.IDevice">IDevice</PageRef>
      interface, please refer to the documentation on that interface for further info.
