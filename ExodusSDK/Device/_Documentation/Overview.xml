  <Section Title="Description">
    <Paragraph>
      The Device library provides a default base class implementation of the <PageRef PageName="ExodusSDK.DeviceInterface.IDevice">IDevice</PageRef>
      interface. This library provides the <PageRef PageName="ExodusSDK.Device.Device">Device</PageRef> base class, which can be inherited from by
      device emulation cores to simplify their implementation. Note that use of the Device library is optional, and the Exodus Platform isn't even
      aware this library exists. A device core is free to implement the IDevice interface directly, and not link to this library at all.
    </Paragraph>
  </Section>

  <Section Title="Status of the library">
    <Paragraph>
      This library is stable, and largely trivial. Please refer to the <PageRef PageName="ExodusSDK.DeviceInterface">DeviceInterface</PageRef>
      library for the interfaces that affect this base class library.
