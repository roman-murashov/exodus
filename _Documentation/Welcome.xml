      Welcome to the Exodus SDK support documentation. The goal of this documentation is to provide all the information necessary to understand the
      architecture and design of the Exodus emulation platform, and how to use the provided APIs and tools to build new emulation cores, and add more
      debug and development features to existing cores, or the platform itself.

      This documentation is a work in progress, and will continue to be expanded and improved as this project advances. The very latest version of
      this documentation can be built as part of the Exodus source repository. A periodically updated version of the documentation will also be
      published online at the project website <doc:XHTMLContent xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><a href="http://www.exodusemulator.com" target="_top">http://www.exodusemulator.com</a>.</doc:XHTMLContent>

  <Section Title="Future Changes">
    <Paragraph>Please note that although the Exodus API has a versioning system for individual interfaces, and will in the future provide full API
    backwards compatibility between versions, as this is a very early release of the API, and there is at this time no known usage of this API outside
    of the Exodus repository itself, the project lead reserves the right to break compatibility with existing code or existing binaries between
    versions. This documentation will note areas of the API that are expected to change in the near future. Feel free to open a discussion on the
    support forums you have any questions or concerns about this.</Paragraph>
